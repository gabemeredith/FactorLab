FactorLabs is a high-performance research framework designed for quantitative developers, students, and data-driven investors. It provides a clean ingestion pipeline, canonical price schema, flexible factor “sleeve” architecture, and lightweight backtesting tools — all built on modern Python tools like Polars and DuckDB.

The project emphasizes transparency, modularity, and speed, allowing you to build and test quant strategies without the bloat of traditional libraries.

🚀 Features
📥 High-Performance Data Ingestion

Yahoo Finance ingestion (ingest_yf.py)

Clean normalization into canonical OHLCV schema

Polars-based transforms

Write to DuckDB or Parquet

Designed to support multiple vendors (Polygon, Tiingo, Alpaca)

⚙️ Fast Analytical Engine

Columnar execution using Polars

SQL interoperability via DuckDB

Zero heavy external dependencies

Vectorized operations instead of loops

🧩 Modular “Sleeves” Architecture

A sleeve is a self-contained module that generates signals or factors.

Examples:

Momentum Sleeve (rolling returns, cross-section ranking)

Mean Reversion Sleeve (z-scores, RSI-style behavior)

Stat-Arb Sleeve (pairs, spreads, cointegration)

ML Sleeve (tree-based predictors, alt-data signals)

Sleeves can be added, combined, weighted, or swapped without rewriting the entire system.

📊 Lightweight Backtester

Daily or intraday frequency

Position sizing & allocation

PnL tracking, benchmark comparison

Drawdown, volatility, Sharpe, turnover

Simple risk model hooks

📦 Installation
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/FactorLabs
cd FactorLabs
pip install -r requirements.txt

🏁 Quick Start
1. Ingest Data
python src/ingest/ingest_yf.py --tickers AAPL MSFT SPY \
                               --start 2018-01-01 \
                               --end 2025-01-01 \
                               --interval 1d

2. Load Processed Data (Python)
from src.core.data_loader import load_prices

df = load_prices("data/processed/prices.parquet")
print(df.head())

3. Run a Simple Sleeve
from src.sleeves.momentum import momentum_signals

signals = momentum_signals(df, window=20)

4. Backtest
from src.backtest.engine import Backtester

bt = Backtester(prices=df, signals=signals)
results = bt.run()
results.plot()

🔧 Development Philosophy

FactorLabs follows three principles:

1. Simplicity > Abstraction

No thousand-line classes.
No magic methods.
Functions, dataclasses, and small modules.

2. Speed by Design

Polars + DuckDB allow fast analytics even on large universes.

3. Hackable by Anyone

Built for learning, experimentation, and extension.
